### Implicit Bias of Gradient Descent on Reparametrized Models: On Equivalence to Mirror Descent

<https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04036>

- With proper parameterization; (commuting and regular) Gradient Flow becomes equivalent with Mirror Flow.
- Also conditions to being good; (meets above) parameterization.
